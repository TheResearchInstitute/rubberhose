For some time now, our group has been working on a
cryptographically-deniable block storage device (aka Rubberhose), on
which regular file-systems can be mounted, targeted at the
human/activist community. We expect to release a developers code set
at the Usenix Security Symposium in Denver next week.

This is like a regular encrypted disk except that it supports multiple
keys, where it is computationally infeasible given some of those keys
to show that there are more keys, or that particular blocks of data
are being used to store something other than unallocated space. Even
for the legitimate user.

This mitigates against coercive interrogations and legal compulsion.
Only "safe" information need be revealed. It isn't possible to show
that additional information exists. Nor is it possible for the subject
of a coercive demand to show that they have revealed all
information. Thus a rational coercer can never demand proof of full
co-operation, as its provision is computationally infeasible.

We have assorted kernel modules for Linux, NetBSD and FreeBSD. Although
these modules are designed to abstract away OS primitives and provide
a fast kernel<->userland messaging layer so the effort involved in
porting to other operating systems is minimised.

However there are ways to protect against coercive interrogations that
can be layered on top of cryptographic deniability. Keying schemes can
be chosen that have beneficial psychological or psychological
properties. These novel keying schemes are often but not always
graphical in nature, which has implementation considerations.

At the moment we have a passphrase-based keying feeding into a
sophisticated key set up routine (that enforces 1 second of original
cpu time per attempted key). However, passphrase based keying is
non-optimal under many circumstances that the target group (human
rights workers) might encounter, because passphrases can be quickly
conveyed by speech or writing. That is:

	1) Interrogations can take place in room101 and not the computer
	   room. It's nicer, particularly given the frequency of
	   equatorial despotism to be tortured in the computer room.

	2) Revealing a passphrase only requires (some of) the brain and
	   jaw or hand to be left functional.

	3) Revealing a passphrase is quick and requires few higher
	   cognitive functions, thus it is vulnerable to peak pain,
	   hallucinogens and `truth drugs' such as schopolomine.

	4) A single observation of a passphrase is enough grasp the
	   whole keying state. Keyboard sniffers are cheap and in
	   Australia at least, video bugging is not uncommon.

A good keying system prevents revealing of the key, placing the
subject of interrogation in a hostile environment (i.e not the
computer room), damage to as many parts of the subject's body as
possible, retardation of the subjects mental faculties and retardation
of the subject's free will. The keying system should also be practical
enough to be used and adopted by real life people, and not require
expensive or hard to find hardware.

Where a group of co-operating individuals is concerned, keying schemes
should discourage defection against the group of individuals being
coersively interrogated. Rubberhose cryptographic deniability
discourages defection due to the subject's inability to show that they
have fully compiled with the interrogation (thus the incentive to
defect, or at least defect completely, is minimised), but perhaps
novel keying schemes can augment this.

It is important to understand that rubberhose requires keying and not
authentication. However any authentication method can be turned into a
keying method, provided sufficient information for the authentication
isn't held on the "server". For an example, rubberhose could issue n
challenges, each of which the user's authentication algorithm
authenticates or fails to authenticate; the hash of the concatenated
authenticated challenges then forms the key. However schemes like this
require n to be >=48, which seems practical only for automated
methods, or combined with another method which presents more bits of
key entropy per iteration.

Some possible alternatives to passphrase based keying (we have some more
notes on these ideas, but no code or concrete design documentation):

	1) interactive transposition matrixes. This is a simple method
	   to prevent keyboard immediate keyboard sniffing. The user
	   keeps their passphrase in their head, and a for each letter
	   a transposition matrix is displayed on the screen.

	2) Maze walking. A maze with several "landmarks" is drawn on
	   the screen. The user must "visit" and move past these landmarks in a
	   particular order and direction.
	   
	3) Enhanced face recognition. Several arrays of faces are displayed.
	   The user must choose the numbers next to each face, perform a
	   simple mathematical operation on them and input the number.

	4) Constraint/simile problems. The user is presented with several
	   secret knowledge problems of A is to B as C is to ? in different
	   forms which test areas of cognitive function and or visual function
	   which would be affected by drugs or severe pain.

	5) Grid drawing. The user draws shapes within a n x n matrix. The direction
	   of boundary crossing forms the key. For a similar idea, see
	   "Graphical Passwords", a paper presented at last years usenix
	   security symposium.

	6) Colour contrast discrimination. It has been shown that individuals see
	   slightly different hues due to visual cortex and cone cell / retina
	   variation. It maybe possible to design moire or 
	   other tests on 24 bit displays which are recognisable by
	   one party but not another. Just hope no-one runs a magnet
	   over your monitor. Interestingly, one drug that this method is
	   highly likely to detect is Viagra, which intereacts with the retinal
	   environment to produce hue distortions. Rubberhose is naturally
	   arousing so we don't see this as being an issue.

	7) Forward Error Correction based biometric keying. Traditionally
	   signature and individual biometric variation tests have failed to
	   provide good alternatives for keying, for two reasons. 1) the
	   bio-authorisation template is "secret", hence useless for something
	   like rubberhose, where *all* secrecy is derived from the key. 2)
	   quantitisation by the template of the inherent analog variability in
	   the biological source in order to match with the template dramatically
	   reduces the keyspace. A FEC based approach may resolve these issues. 

Our current designs for plugable keying mechanims, simply introduce saved
state on stdin and expect output state (which is subsequently hashed
to form the key) on stdout.

What follows is a proto-type of 5 in Ocaml (http://www.ocaml.org/), although of
course almost any language can be used.

As novel keying methods are an intresting problem that requires
lateral thinking rather than specialist cryptographic expertise, I
thought it may be of interest to ocaml coders in general.
